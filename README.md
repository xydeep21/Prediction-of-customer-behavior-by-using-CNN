# Prediction-of-customer-behavior-by-using-CNN
 Due to customer privacy concerns, (simulated) participants' real response data is not provided, but instead, we've created images out of the response data. Each participant's response information is captured by one image. These pics will not lose any information and I will use these pics to predict the customer behavior based on the Keras-CNN model.
